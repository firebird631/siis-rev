$ source <siis.venv>/bin/activate

replace <x> by your most recent Python version and <siis.venv> by any folder name you want or keep that.


Microsoft Windows

From a command prompt :

$ python3.<x>.exe /m venv <siis.venv>
$ <siis.venv>\Scripts\activate

    .siis/
    |- config/
      |- strategy.ini
      |- connectors/
